1. User Authentication and Authorization:
  a. Implement secure user login and registration using email/password or social logins (e.g., Google, Facebook).
  b. Utilize secure token-based authentication (JWT) to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
2. Social Media Account Connections:
  a. Allow users to connect their primary social media accounts (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) to the dashboard.
  b. Integrate with the official APIs of these platforms to retrieve and display user data securely. This will involve acquiring API keys and following their authorization processes.
3. Basic Data Visualization and Insights:
  a. Provide users with essential data visualizations for key metrics like follower growth, engagement rates, reach, and impressions. You can start with simple bar charts and line graphs.
  b. Offer basic reports that summarize user data and provide insights into overall social media performance.
4. Content Management (Optional):
  a. Consider if allowing users to create and schedule basic social media posts directly from the dashboard would be valuable for your target audience. This can be added in the future if user feedback suggests its importance.
